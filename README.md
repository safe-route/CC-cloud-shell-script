# List of Commands or Scripts for GCP

This repository as the title suggest, is a collection of script used for resource deployement to GCP.

## Summary

Acting as a step tracer for each deployment in Google cloud platform (but did not contain **ALL** of the steps of provisioning resources). Meant as a way to keep deployment constant as we do not have any CI/CD pipelines set.

## Reference

We mainly use google docs as a basis, for example [cloud run we folow this documentation](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying), and other docs that are too numerous to include but this can act as a principle of where we took some steps.

Other than that various general vendor specifics such as **Docker** is also used but as this is pertains to each person knowledge and skill we will not list all of that docs (which in itself can be trivial) we used.

## Structure

In the repository root, with following format {service-fill-whitespace-with-gaps}_{image/cloud run service name}.

## Usage

Just read the markdown.
